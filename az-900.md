# AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

### How I got certified (at no cost)

First things first: I started my self-learning path by reading all six modules from [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/).

To complement the reading with extra resources, I signed up for the [Microsoft Azure Virtual Training Day](https://events.microsoft.com/), a free online fast-paced course given by @Microsoft technical trainers to review all the concepts. _**Attending this event also enables you to take the certification exam at no cost**_.

To check my knowledge prior to the exam, I used these practice tests which, in my opinion, are the the best ones out there:

* @MarczakIO [Practice Tests](https://marczak.io/az-900/)

* [ExamTopics Practice Questions](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-900/view/)

Finally, after feeling confident, I scheduled my exam and passed!
